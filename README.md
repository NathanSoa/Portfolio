# Portfolio

Hello dear visitor! This is my first project that is claimed to be a Portfolio, this project is part of a course made by <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css/" target="_blank">Front-end Masters</a>, it's a very simple project, just use pure CSS and HTML.

## GOALS

My goal with that project is to practice CSS and layout in landing pages, I never made one before, so that project was very nice to me, applying some CSS rules that I wasn't used with. After that, I plan to study more about CSS and more frontend techs to create an app that I could say "It was made 100% by me".
